I come from a creative background, having held leadership roles that gave me a unique perspective. Being of mixed Māori and British descent, I’m proud of my heritage. I’m a 39-year-old male, straight, and currently I am an adult student, pursuing my academic goals.

I have also navigated the complex world of mental health, dealing with a variety of psychological challenges. These personal experiences have provided me with a deeper empathy and understanding of the struggles faced by individuals in similar circumstances.

## Question 2 - What needs do you have relating to your personal wellness?  

**You may choose to consider what your physical, spiritual, mental or emotional needs are.**

> [!NOTE]
> - Remembering that I am in control of how I react to the emotions I feel
> - Taking care of my physical body as an act of generosity to others

Regarding my wellness, it is essential to monitor my physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional needs. I must remember that I hold the power to determine my reactions to my emotions. Caring for my body is not solely for my benefit; it also serves as a means of generosity towards others. By maintaining an active lifestyle, eating healthily, and ensuring adequate rest, I am better prepared to support my friends and family.

## Question 3 - What does wellness look like for you, personally and at work?

> [!NOTE]
> Life is good personally when…
> 
> Life is good at work when…
> 

To me, wellness involves maintaining a balance among the body, mind, and spirit. This encompasses regular physical activity, mindfulness practices, and nurturing meaningful relationships. In the workplace, it entails cultivating an environment where everyone feels supported and stress is minimized. Essential elements include open communication and access to self-care resources. 

Ultimately, wellness for me personally and at work involves creating a positive and supportive environment for all.

## Question 4 - What are some factors that have a negative impact on your wellness, personally and at work?

> [!NOTE]
> My personal wellness is negatively impacted when…
> 
> My wellness at work is negatively impacted when…
> 

Deadlines in the workplace have a significant impact on me. Initially, they serve as a motivator, but they can rapidly become overwhelming. This stress adversely affects my productivity. 

Personally, the thought of disappointing someone weighs heavily on me, leading to withdrawal and reduced communication. It is crucial to recognize these patterns to manage them more effectively and maintain a healthy balance.

## Question 5 - What is the first self-care strategy you will use?  

**Include specific details of when, where and how you will use the self-care strategy.**

> [!NOTE]
> 1. Commit to a routine that includes
> 	- Physical activity
> 	- Regular sleep-wake cycles
> 	- Practicing intentional gratitude

The first self-care strategy I will use is Regular engagement in physical activity, such as drumming exercises and/or walking:

To ensure regular physical activity, I will commit to practicing drums for 30 minutes every morning. Dedicating this time in my music room will allow me to improve my drumming skills, coordination, and rhythm. Engaging in this creative and expressive musical activity not only involves physical movement but also brings enjoyment and fulfilment.

I have created a weekly schedule as well as individual routines for each day. I have researched via online sources to implement a variety of activities and exercises that will facilitate improvement and keep me interested. This will also be a framework by which I can measure my progression over time. These have been attached below.

**Drum Practice Schedule:**

Additionally, I could incorporate walking into my daily routine by taking my dog for a brisk walk during my lunch break or in the evenings after dinner. This will not only allow me to enjoy the fresh air and explore nearby parks or nature trails but also provide exercise and mental stimulation for my furry companion.

## Question 6 - What is the second self-care strategy you will use?

**Include specific details of when, where and how you will use the self-care strategy.**

> [!NOTE]
> Setting short and long-term goals in relation to
> - Physical activity 
> - Weekly accomplishments

The second self-care strategy I will use is **Maintaining consistent sleep-wake cycles by establishing a regular bedtime and wake-up time:**

To maintane consistant sleep-wake cycles, I'm gonna set a regular bedtime of 11 PM and wake up at 7 AM. For a restful sleep, I'll make sure to create a comfy sleep environment and a chill bedtime routine. This might include stuff like reading a book or listening to calm music, letting my body wind down and get ready for sleep. Plus, I'll keep my bedroom dark, quite, and at a cool temperature.
