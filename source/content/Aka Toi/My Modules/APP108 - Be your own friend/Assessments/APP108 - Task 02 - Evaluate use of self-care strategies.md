# APP108 - Task 02 - Evaluate use of self-care strategies

> [!NOTE]
> - Think about how you used the self-care strategies over the 6 weeks and answer the following questions. Your self-care record may give you specific examples you can use.

Self-care strategies found here [[APP108 - Task 01 - Question 7 continued]]

## Question 1 - For the first self-care strategy, what didn’t go well and why?

During the first weeks, I ran into a bit of trouble with my fingers feeling sore after a few days of drumming. Also, the weather was often rainy, making the walks with Nomad less enjoyable and more wet. These chalenges showed me the need for adjustments in my routine to handle physical limits and with the routine itself, to allow for worse external conditions in the wetter seasons.

## Question 2 - For the first self-care strategy, what went well and why?

The drumming sessions were energizing and a great way to start the day, leading to small but noticeable improvements in coordination and rhythm. Walking with Nomad not only gave me physical exercise but also brought a sense of peace and companionship that really lifted my spirits.

## Question 3 - For the second self-care strategy, what didn’t go well and why?

I had trouble falling asleep on some nights because of overthinking and stress. Those nights threw off my sleep-wake cycle a bit, showing me just how much mental stress can mess with my routine.

---
## Question 4 - For the second self-care strategy, what went well and why?

Keeping a consistent sleep schedule and practicing gratitude each morning helped me feel more motivated and I engaged in more activities during the days. The gratitude practice, in particular, set a positive tone. I even noticed on a few occasions that my inner monologue included some positive words that felt new. I think this helped me feel more connected with my friends and family, which was an awesome thing to experience.

---
## Question 5 - How did these self-care strategies minimise the negative impacts on your wellness?

These self-care strategies were like a safety net, giving me structure and routine that helped keep stres in check and my mind clear. Drumming and walking were great outlets for both physical and emotional energy, while the sleep routine and gratitude practice kept me mentally strong and positive.

---
## Question 6 - Think about what went well with your self-care strategies. What will you continue to do?

I’m definitely going to keep drummming and walking as part of my daily routine because they’ve been so good for my body and mind. Plus, I’ll stick with my sleep schedule and gratitude practice since they’re key to keeping me grounded and positive.

## Question 7 - Think about what didn’t go well with your self-care strategies. What could you do differently to support your wellness?  

To tackle the challenges I faced, I’m planning to be more flexible with my routine, like adjusting activities based on how I’m feeling and the weather. I’m also going to try out some new relaxation techniques to help manage stress and improve my sleep, aiming for a more balanced approach to self-care.
