## Question 2 - What needs do you have relating to your personal wellness?  

**You may choose to consider what your physical, spiritual, mental or emotional needs are.**

> [!NOTE]-
> - Remembering that I am in control of how I react to the emotions I feel
> - Taking care of my physical body as an act of generosity to others

Regarding my wellness, it is essential to monitor my physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional needs. I must remember that I hold the power to determine my reactions to my emotions. Caring for my body is not solely for my benefit; it also serves as a means of generosity towards others. By maintaining an active lifestyle, eating healthily, and ensuring adequate rest, I am better prepared to support my friends and family.

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Version.02</mark>
When it comes to my personal wellness, I recognize the importance of addressing my physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs. One crucial aspect is acknowledging that I have control over how I react to the emotions I experience. This entails being mindful of my emotional responses and actively choosing positive and constructive reactions. I believe that taking care of my physical body is not only beneficial for myself but also an act of generosity towards others. By prioritizing regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, and getting enough rest, I am better equipped to contribute positively to my relationships and responsibilities. Understanding and meeting these needs are essential for maintaining my personal wellness and overall well-being.

## Question 3 - What does wellness look like for you, personally and at work?

> Life is good personally when…
> 
> Life is good at work when…

To me, wellness involves maintaining a balance among the body, mind, and spirit. This encompasses regular physical activity, mindfulness practices, and nurturing meaningful relationships. In the workplace, it entails cultivating an environment where everyone feels supported and stress is minimized. Essential elements include open communication and access to self-care resources. 

Ultimately, wellness for me personally and at work involves creating a positive and supportive environment for all.

Personally, wellness entails maintaining a healthy balance between my physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. This includes engaging in regular exercise, practicing mindfulness and self-care, and nurturing meaningful relationships. It also involves seeking support when needed and continuously working on personal growth and self-awareness. 

In the workplace, wellness involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment that promotes mental well-being for both colleagues and clients. This includes implementing strategies to reduce stress, fostering open communication, and providing resources for self-care and professional development.

## Question 4 - What are some factors that have a negative impact on your wellness, personally and at work?

> [!NOTE]-
> My personal wellness is negatively impacted when…
> 
> My wellness at work is negatively impacted when…
> 


Deadlines in the workplace have a significant impact on me. Initially, they serve as a motivator, but they can rapidly become overwhelming. This stress adversely affects my productivity. 

Personally, the thought of disappointing someone weighs heavily on me, leading to withdrawal and reduced communication. It is crucial to recognize these patterns to manage them more effectively and maintain a healthy balance.


<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Version.02</mark>
At work, one example is the pressure of impending deadlines. While deadlines can initially be motivating, I sometimes allow them to overwhelm me to the point where they can become crippling. This can lead to increased stress, decreased productivity, and a negative impact on my overall well-being. 

On a personal level, a similar pattern emerges when I feel like I have let someone down. In such situations, my emotions can overwhelm me, causing me to become less communicative and withdrawn. This can further exacerbate my feelings of guilt and impact my overall mental and emotional wellness.

Recognizing these factors and developing strategies to manage them is crucial in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and personal well-being in the field of mental health.

## Question 5 - What is the first self-care strategy you will use?  

**Include specific details of when, where and how you will use the self-care strategy.**

> [!NOTE]-
> 1. Commit to a routine that includes
> 	- Physical activity
> 	- Regular sleep-wake cycles
> 	- Practicing intentional gratitude

The first self-care strategy I will use is Regular engagement in physical activity, such as drumming exercises and/or walking:

To ensure regular physical activity, I will commit to practicing drums for 30 minutes every morning. Dedicating this time in my music room will allow me to improve my drumming skills, coordination, and rhythm. Engaging in this creative and expressive musical activity not only involves physical movement but also brings enjoyment and fulfilment.

I have created a weekly schedule as well as individual routines for each day. I have researched via online sources to implement a variety of activities and exercises that will facilitate improvement and keep me interested. This will also be a framework by which I can measure my progression over time. These have been attached below.

For reference.

```

Additionally, I could incorporate walking into my daily routine by taking my dog for a brisk walk during my lunch break or in the evenings after dinner. This will not only allow me to enjoy the fresh air and explore nearby parks or nature trails but also provide exercise and mental stimulation for my furry companion.

Practicing intentional gratitude in daily life:

To practice intentional gratitude in daily life, I will incorporate gratitude exercises into my morning routine. Upon waking up, I will take a few moments to reflect on three things I am grateful for. I will write them down in a gratitude journal, noting specific details and reasons for my gratitude. Throughout the day, I will make an effort to express gratitude to others, whether through a simple thank you or a heartfelt compliment. I will practice mindfulness by regularly pausing to appreciate the present moment and the positive aspects of my surroundings.

## Question 6 - What is the second self-care strategy you will use?

**Include specific details of when, where and how you will use the self-care strategy.**

> [!NOTE]-
> Setting short and long-term goals in relation to
> - Physical activity 
> - Weekly accomplishments

The second self-care strategy I will use is **Maintaining consistent sleep-wake cycles by establishing a regular bedtime and wake-up time:**

To maintane consistant sleep-wake cycles, I'm gonna set a regular bedtime of 11 PM and wake up at 7 AM. For a restful sleep, I'll make sure to create a comfy sleep environment and a chill bedtime routine. This might include stuff like reading a book or listening to calm music, letting my body wind down and get ready for sleep. Plus, I'll keep my bedroom dark, quite, and at a cool temperature.

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Version.02</mark>
**Setting short and long-term goals in relation to physical activity and tracking my weekly accomplishments.** 

By establishing specific goals, I can create a clear roadmap to guide my physical activity journey. These goals can be both short-term, such as aiming to exercise for a certain duration or intensity each day, and long-term, such as working towards completing a marathon or achieving a specific fitness milestone. 

I will track my weekly accomplishments, noting my progress and celebrating small victories along the way. This practice of setting goals and acknowledging achievements will not only keep me motivated but also provide a sense of fulfilment and satisfaction, contributing to my overall well-being and personal growth.
